    """
    The function takes in a number (either int or float) and returns the largest perfect square
    that is less than the given number.

    Arguments:
    number (int, float): The input number to check for the largest perfect square less than it.

    Assumptions:
    - The input number must be a non-negative number (either integer or float).

    Returns:
    int:
        - The largest perfect square that is less than the input number.
        - If no perfect square exists (i.e., for inputs less than or equal to 1 or equal to 0),
        the function will return 0.



    Raises:
    AssertionError: If the input is a negative number (integer or float).
    AssertionError: If the input is not a number (neither integer nor float).

    Examples:
        >>> largest_perfect_square_less_than_number(50)
        49

        >>> largest_perfect_square_less_than_number(16.5)
        9

        >>> largest_perfect_square_less_than_number(1)
        0

        >>> largest_perfect_square_less_than_number(100.99)
