# Retrospective

*"The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing."*
*— Henry Ford*

## Stop Doing

- **Lack of Active Participation:** Due to some personal issues, some team members
  were less active, which slowed down progress. In the future, we need
  to ensure clearer communication regarding availability and constraints.

- **Underestimating the Importance of the Project Board:** We didn’t fully
  recognize the value of using the GitHub project board at the start. This resulted
  in some miscommunication as some members had to ask about which solutions need
  to be reviewed.

## Continue Doing

- **Collaboration and Flexibility**: When some members struggled in dealing with
  GitHub and Python, others where there to help which ensured successful
  submission of solutions and reviews in time. Also, when some members didn’t
  find solutions to review, others implemented additional solution to provide
  challenges for teammates to review. **We should continue such actions to ensure
  our success in the Certificate program.**

- **Regular code reviews using GitHub:** Now since we have seen how better it
  is to communicate about the code through Github,
  all of us are focusing on developing this skill for better code management.

- **Regular Check-ins:** Having meetings helped us stay connected and
  clear on progress, despite some delays.

## Start Doing

- **Deadlines, deadlines, deadlines**: We should've set clear deadlines for each
  task. This would've ensured early successful submission of the project and
  we will have enough to fix any last-minute errors/problems.

- **Organized Project Board and Label Usage:** We need to use the GitHub project
  board more efficiently. This would ensure effective communication and delivery.
  Also, we need to write more about the code in the description of the PR/issue.
  This is something we didn't stick to in this project as the solutions were simple.

- **Clearer Role Definition:** It’s important that to define individual roles
  and responsibilities more clearly from the first meeting. This will ensure
  each member understands their specific contributions.

- **Capabilities Discussion**: We have to discuss our capabilities of using the tools
  that will be used in detail, not just saying "I'm beginner". This would help
  making it clear from the beginning which members will need help the most.

## Lessons Learned

- **Collaboration, collaboration, collaboration:** Team members on any project
  should collaborate effectively with one another. This ensures not only the
  successful delivery of the project but also that no individual is
  burdened with more work than necessary.

- **Marketing on GitHub**: Given that most programmers and companies worldwide
  utilize GitHub, it's highly beneficial to start developing projects and
  sharing them on this platform. At more advanced levels, contributing
  to open-source projects can significantly enhance both experience
  and professional portfolio.

- **Reviews and feedback:** Do not assume your code is great or easily readable
  unless your teammates confirm it. This isn't about doubting your abilities;
  rather, clear comprehension in your mind doesn't guarantee others will
  understand it similarly. **Therefore, CODE REVIEWS ARE CRUCIAL!**

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- We successfully submitted all the solutions and reviews in time and
  didn't have to deal with last-minute problems.
- We have all learned the basics of Git and GitHub, along with the
  essentials of testing and code reviewing. This is the start to a long journey!
  
### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Communication. Despite of the successful delivery of the project, this aspect
  should be further enhanced.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Some members had issues that prevented them from learning some Git and Github basics
  in advance, therefore, we needed to conduct meetings to tackle this issue.

### Or remove extra steps?

Last but not least, we believe that it's time to look for a new group
name. We are not buggy after all since our solutions worked perfectly!
Soooo, What about **The Bug Busters?**
