# Retrospective

*"The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing."*
*— Henry Ford*

## Stop Doing

- **Lack of Active Participation:** Due to some personal issues, some team members
  were less active, which slowed down progress. In the future, we need
  to ensure clearer communication regarding availability and constraints.

- **Underestimating the Importance of the Project Board:** We didn’t fully
  recognize the value of using the GitHub project board at the start. This resulted
  in some miscommunication as some members had to ask about which solutions need
  to be reviewed.

## Continue Doing

- **Collaboration and Flexibility**: When some members struggled in dealing with
  GitHub and Python, others where there to help which ensured successful
  submission of solutions and reviews in time. Also, when some members didn’t
  find solutions to review, others implemented additional solution to provide
  challenges for teammates to review. **We should continue such actions to help
  our success in the Certificate program.**
- **Regular code reviews using GitHub:** Now since we have seen how better it
  is to communicate about the code through Github,
  all of us are focusing on developing this skill for better code management.
- **Regular Check-ins:** Having meetings helped us stay connected and
  clear on progress, despite some delays.

## Start Doing

- **Deadlines, deadlines, deadlines**: We should've set clear deadlines for each
  task. This would've ensured early successful submission of the project and
  we will have enough to fix any last-minute errors/problems.
- **Organized Project Board and Label Usage:** We need to use the GitHub project
  board more efficiently. This would ensure effective communication and delivery.
  Also, we need to write more about the code in the description of the PR/issue.
  This is something we didn't stick to in this project as the solutions were simple.
- **Clearer Role Definition:** It’s important that to define individual roles
  and responsibilities more clearly from the first meeting. This will ensure
  each member understands their specific contributions.
- **Capabilities Discussion**: We have to discuss our capabilities of using the tools
  that will be used in detail, not just saying "I'm beginner". This would help
  making it clear from the beginning which members will need help the most.

## Lessons Learned

- **Collaboration, collaboration, collaboration:** Team members in any project
  should be effectively collaborating with each other. Besides ensuring successful
  delivery of the project, such communication will ensure that no members do more
  than they have to.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?
